    "dialogue": "Let's let's my work is here now my family's here and I agreed to put Henry in school here because your show went to series I did that knowing that when you were done shooting he will come back to New York Honey, we never said that that may have been your assumption But we never expressly said that we did say it when did we say it? I don't know We said it, but we said it. We said at the time on the phone honey. Let me fit it Sorry, I keep saying that I thought that if Henry was happy here and my show continued that we might do LA for a while I was not privy to that thought process The only reason we didn't live here is because you can't imagine desires other than your own unless they're forced on you Okay, you wish you hadn't married me. You wish you had a different life, but this is what happened So what do we do? Norris says there's no coming back from this Fuck Nora. He fucking Nora telling me I always lived in LA even though I never lived in LA How could you have said those things about me? Jay said them about me, too You shouldn't have fired Bert. I need to my own asshole Let's just both agree both of our lawyers said shitty stuff about both of us. Nora was worse Jay called me an alcoholic pulled the rug out from under me and you're putting me through hell You put me through hell during our marriage. Oh, it's not what that was hell I know you're gonna put Henry through this horrible things you could yet again get what you want It's not what I want. I mean, it's what I want, but it's what was was What's best for him oh? Well, I was wondering when you get around to Henry and what he actually wants fuck off. No, you fuck off If you listen to your son or anyone, then he tell you that he'd rather live here stop Into your feelings about me on to Henry. He tells me he likes it better here He tells you because he knows it's what you want to hear He tells me you're on the phone all the time. You don't even play with him because I'm going through a divorce in LA And trying to direct a play in New York which closed because I wasn't there. It's a huge opportunity Fighting for something you don't even want You're being so much like your father Do not compare me to my father. I didn't compare you to him. I said you were acting like him You're exactly like your mother everything you're complaining about her you're doing you're suffocating Henry first of all I love my mother. She was a wonderful mother. Just repeating what you told me How dare you compare my mother into my mother? I may be like my father, but I am not like my mother You are and you're like my father. You're also like my mother. You're all the bad things about all of these people But mostly your mother when we would lie in bed together Sometimes I would look at you and see her and just feel so gross. I felt repulsed when you touched your slob I made all the bags Heal my skin off you'll never be happy and now lay here anywhere You'll think you found some better opposite guy than me and in a few years You rebel against him because you need to have your voice, but you don't want a voice You just want to fucking complain about not having a voice. I think about being married to you and that woman is a stranger to me I mean we had a child",
