That sucks. So, uh, when are you done with those meetings? I think the week after I'm 21. Yeah, are they going to hook you up with a job or what? Yeah, fucking sitting in a room and doing long division for the next 50 years. Yeah. Probably make some nice bang, though. We have fucking elaborate. Better than this shit. Way out of here. I want a way out of here for her. I mean, I'm going to fucking live here the rest of my life. You know, being neighbors, you know. We'll have little kids fucking taking a little league together up fully failed. Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. In 20 years, if you're still living here, coming over my house to watch the Patriots game, you're still working construction. I fucking kill you. That's not a threat. That's a fact. I fucking kill you. Fucking talking about. Look, you got something none of us. Oh, come on. Why is it always this? I mean, I fucking know it's myself to do this. That wouldn't find it hard to. No, no, no. I'll fuck you. You don't know it to yourself. You owe it to me. It's tomorrow. I'm going to wake up and I'll be 50. And I'll still be doing this shit. That's all right. That's fine. I mean, you're sitting on a winning lottery ticket. You're too much of a pussy to cash in. Hey. That's bullshit. Because I do fucking anything to have, but you got it. So would any of these fucking guys. Be an insult to watch if you're still here in 20 years. I ain't around here until fucking waste the other time. You don't know that. I don't? No. You don't know. I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do. Every day I come by your house and I pick you up. When you go out, we have a few drinks, and a few laughs, and it's great. You know what the best part of my day is? It's for about 10 seconds. When I pull up to the curb when I get to your door. Because I think maybe I'll get up there and I'm not going to door. You won't be there. I don't go by. I know CLA and I know nothing. I'm just laughing. I don't watch, but I know that.",
