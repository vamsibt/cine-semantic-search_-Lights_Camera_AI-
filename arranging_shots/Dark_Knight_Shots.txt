Shot 1 :

ALFRED
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt
and you can swap not sleeping in a
penthouse for not sleeping in a
mansion.
Alfred places a cup of coffee in front of Wayne, who is
STITCHING up a cut on his arm.
ALFRED (CONT’D)
(takes needle)
When you stitch yourself up you make
a bloody mess.
WAYNE
But I learn from my mistakes.
ALFRED
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.
WAYNE
My armor... I'm carrying too much
weight- I need to be faster.
ALFRED
I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.
(looks at wound)
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
WAYNE
A dog.
(off look)
A big dog. There were more copycats
last night, Alfred. With guns.
ALFRED
Perhaps you could hire some of them
and take weekends off.
WAYNE
This wasn't exactly what I had in
mind when I said I wanted to inspire
people.
ALFRED
I know. But things are improving.
Look at the new District Attorney...
Wayne indicates a monitor: a handsome MAN in a suit.
WAYNE
I am. Closely. I need to know if he
can be trusted.
Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.
Campaigning. Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.
ALFRED
Are you interested in his
character... or his social circle?
WAYNE
Who Rachel spends her time with is
her business.
ALFRED
Well, I trust you're not following me
on my day off.
WAYNE
If you ever took one, I might.
Alfred bites the thread. Examines his stitches. Looks at
the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.
ALFRED
Know your limits, Master Wayne.
WAYNE
Batman has no limits.
ALFRED
Well, you do, sir.
WAYNE
I can't afford to know them.
ALFRED
And what happens the day you find
out?
WAYNE
We all know how much you like to say
'I told you so'.
ALFRED
That day, Master Wayne, even I won't
want to. Probably.


Shot 2 :


INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
HARVEY DENT bursts into the courtroom. Assistant D.A. RACHEL
DAWES, look up, ANNOYED.
DENT
Sorry I'm late, folks.
Rachel leans in to Dent, speaking under her breath.
RACHEL
Where were you?
DENT
Worried you'd have to step up?
RACHEL
I know the briefs backwards.
Dent pulls a large silver dollar out of his pocket. Grins.
DENT
Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll
take it. Tails, he's all yours.
Dent FLIPS. Shows it to Rachel- heads.
RACHEL
You're flipping coins to see who
leads?
DENT
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.
RACHEL
I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave
things like this to chance.
DENT
I don't.
(sincere)
I make my own luck.
Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.
MARONI
I thought the DA just played golf
with the Mayor, things like that.
DENT
Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough
time to put you away for life, Sally.
The BAILIFFS lead a THIN MAN into the witness box. ROSSI.
INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
Rossi takes a SIP of water. Dent works the room.
DENT
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham,
someone must've stepped up to run the
so-called family.
(Rossi nods)
Is this man in the courtroom today?
(Rossi nods again)
Could you identify him for us,
please?
Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced. Dent smiles.
ROSSI
You win, counselor. It was me.
Dent's smile disappears. He turns back to Rossi.
DENT
I've got a sworn statement from you
that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
the new head of the Falcone crime
family.
ROSSI
Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
brains of the organization.
LAUGHS from the gallery. Dent turns to the JUDGE.
DENT
Permission to treat the witness as
hostile?
ROSSI
Hostile? I'll show you hostile.
Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face. SCREAMS from
the gallery. Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with
a POP. Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with a
RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of
Maroni.
DENT
Ceramic 28 caliber. Made in China.
If you want to kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
American.
Everyone STARES, open-mouthed, as Dent adjusts his tie. The
Bailiffs are wrestling Rossi from the boxDENT (CONT’D)
But, your honor, I'm not done...
INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY
Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.
RACHEL
We'll never link the gun to Maroni,
so we can't charge him, but I'll tell
you one thing- the fact they tried to
kill you means we're getting to them.
DENT
Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm
fine by the way.
Rachel turns to Dent. Smooths his lapels.
RACHEL
Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if
you're not getting shot at, you're
not doing your job.
(smiles)
'Course if you said you were rattled
we could take the rest of the day...
DENT
Can't. I dragged the head of the
Major Crimes Unit down here.
RACHEL
Jim Gordon? He's a friend- try to be
nice.

Shot 3 :

INT. DENT'S OFFICE -- DAY
Gordon stands as Dent enters. The two men shake.
GORDON
Word is you've got a hell of a right
cross. Shame Sal's going to walk.
DENT
Well, good thing about the mob is
they keep giving you second chances.
Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.
DENT
Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy
stuff for a city cop. Have help?
GORDON
We liaise with various agenciesDENT
Save it, Gordon. I want to meet him.
GORDON
Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.
DENT
And that flood light on top of
M.C.U.?
GORDON
If you have any concerns about...
malfunctioning equipment... take them
up with maintenance, counselor.
Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk. Annoyed.
DENT
I've put every known money launderer
in Gotham behind bars. But the mob
is still getting its money out. I
think you and your "friend" have
found the last game in town and
you're trying to hit 'em where it
hurts: their wallets. Bold. You
gonna count me in?
GORDON
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.
DENT
Gordon, I don't like that you've got
your own special unit, and I don't
like that it's full of cops I
investigated at internal affairs.
GORDON
If I didn't work with cops you'd
investigated while you were making
your name at I.A.- I'd be working
alone. I don't get political points
for being an idealist- I have to do
the best I can with what I have.
Dent looks at Gordon. Considering how to proceed.
DENT
You want me to back warrants for
search and seizure on five banks
without telling me who we're after?
GORDON
I can give you the names of the
banks.
DENT
Well, that's a start. I'll get you
your warrants. But I want your
trust.
GORDON
(rises)
You don't have to sell me, Dent. We
all know you're Gotham's white
knight.
DENT
(grins)
I hear they've got a different
nickname for me down at M.C.U..
Gordon smiles.

Shot 4 : 

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
LUCIUS FOX, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and the board listen to
LAU, 40s, CEO of L.S.I. Holdings.
LAU
In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for
dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese
venture with Wayne Enterprises will
be a powerhouse.
FOX
Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of
the board, and Mr.Wayne, in
expressing our own excitement...
The Chinese look to the head of the table: Wayne, ASLEEP.


Shot 5 :

REESE
Sir, I know Mr.Wayne's curious how
his trust fund gets replenished but
frankly... it's embarrassing.
Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.
FOX
You worry about the diligence, Mr.
Reese. I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
REESE
It's done- the numbers are solid.
FOX
(smiles)
Do it again. Wouldn't want the trust
fund to run out, would we?


Shot 6 :

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne is standing by the window.
FOX
Another long night?
(Wayne smiles)
This joint venture was your idea, and
the consultants love it, but I'm not
convinced. L.S.I.'s grown 8 percent
annually, like clockwork. They must
have a revenue stream that's off the
books. Maybe even illegal.
WAYNE
OK. Cancel the deal.
FOX
(looks at Wayne)
You already knew.
WAYNE
I needed a closer look at their
books.
Fox looks at Wayne. Wry.
FOX
Anything else you can trouble me for?
WAYNE
I need a new suit.
FOX
(looks him over)
Three buttons is a little nineties.
WAYNE
I'm not talking about fashion,
Mr.Fox, so much as function.
Wayne pulls some diagrams. Fox looks them over.
FOX
You want to be able to turn your
head?
WAYNE
Sure make backing out of the driveway
easier.
FOX
I'll see what I can do.


Shot 7 :

INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
Rachel and Dent at a table. Dent looks a little intimidated
by the surroundings.
DENT
It took three weeks to get a
reservation and I had to tell them I
worked for the government.
RACHEL
Really?
DENT
This city health inspector's not
afraid to pull strings.
Rachel smiles. Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne
enter, accompanied by a beautiful woman.
DENT
What?
WAYNE
Rachel! Fancy that.
RACHEL
Yes, Bruce. Fancy that.
INT. SAME -- LATER
They finish up dinner.
NATASCHA
No, come on- how could you want to
raise children in a city like this?
WAYNE
I was raised here. I turned out OK.
DENT
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
Rachel gives Dent a withering look.
WAYNE
The Palisades? Sure. You know, as
our new D.A. you might want to figure
out where your jurisdiction ends.
NATASCHA
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante...
DENT
Gotham's proud of an ordinary man
standing up for what's right.
NATASCHA
Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
officials, not a man who thinks he's
above the law.
WAYNE
Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
DENT
We did. All of us who stood by and
let scum take control of our city.
Wayne watches Dent. Sees his passion.
NATASCHA
But this is a democracy, Harvey.
DENT
When their enemies were at the gate,
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the
city. It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered public service.
RACHEL
And the last man they asked to
protect the republic was named
Caesar. He never gave up that power.
DENT
Well, I guess you either die a hero
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain. Look,
whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to spend the rest of his life
doing this. How could he?
(MORE)
DENT (cont'd)
~Batman's looking for someone to take
up his mantle.
NATASCHA
Someone like you, Mr.Dent?
DENT
Maybe. If I'm up to it.
Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.
NATASCHA
But what if Harvey Dent is the caped
crusader?
DENT
If I were sneaking out every night
someone would've noticed by now.
Dent takes Rachel's hand. Rachel glances at Wayne. Awkward.
WAYNE
Well, you've sold me, Dent. I'm
gonna throw you a fundraiser.
DENT
That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
not up for reelection for three
years. That stuff won't start forWAYNE
I don't think you understand. One
fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
need another cent.
